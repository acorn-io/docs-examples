# Hugo Example

## Using this demo

This is a bare bones Hugo application. It is meant to have the Acornfile built as part of the [Docs exercise](https://docs.acorn.io/Develop%20with%20Acorn/Develop%20with%20Acorn). If you would like to skip that, you can copy the `Acorn.cue.complete` to `acorn.cue`.
